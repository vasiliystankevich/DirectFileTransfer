    <releaseNotes>**Version 2.0.11**
      Allows the creation of mappings with arbitrary Private IP address.
      Fixes defect #22. 
        - Routers failed with 404 when service control url had a question mark (?) 
        - DD-WRT Linux base router (and others probably) fails with 402-InvalidArgument when index is out of range. 
        - Some routers retuns invalid mapping entries with empty internal client.

      Fixes defect #24.
      GetSpecificMappingEntry fails with 402-InvalidArgument in DD-WRT Linux base router when mapping is not found.
